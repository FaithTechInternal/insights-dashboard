## üöÄ Getting Started

These are the instructions for setting up a local development environment.

### Installation

Clone this repository

Set up your server environment variables:

1. Go to the `server` directory under the root of this project.
1. Copy `.env.template` to `.env`
1. Set GITHUB_TOKEN to a GitHub Personal Access Token you create with the following permissions:
   - `repo`, `admin:org/read:org,` `read:project`, `read:discussion`

Install the server:
```bash
$ cd <PROJECT-ROOT>/server
$ npm install
```

Install the client:
```bash
$ cd <PROJECT-ROOT>/client
$ npm install
```

### Running the app

Start up the database

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```
